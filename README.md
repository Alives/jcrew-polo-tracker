# jcrew_tracker
A python script that uses selenium and phamtomjs to alert on J.Crew product
changes.

I wrote this to be alerted on the changes of specific product offerings.
Changes being any product addtions, price changes, or product removals.

It requires that phantomjs and selenium are installed.  Pushbullet notifications
require the pushbullet.py pip module.

The script is intended to be run by cron.
