# jcrew-polo-tracker
A cronjob to alert me of new jcrew polo sales and styles

I wrote this to be alerted on new colors and styles because these are mostly all I wear.

It requires that casperjs be installed from nodejs and bsd-mailx for sending the multipart emails (html).

Modify the shell script to match your environment and run it via cron.
